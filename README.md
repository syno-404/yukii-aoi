## About Me

Hi! I'm Aoi! Welcome to my profile. I'm a normal Front-end Developer and Web Designer from Vietnam.
I also have a few other nicknames, mostly from my old Discord usernames like Himiko, Nya... you can call me by these names if you want. However, if you know my real name, don't call it by it because I don't like revealing my real name.

My waifu is Wu Yao Yao from [My Fake Girlfriend's Defending Against Their Attacks](https://www.bilibilicomics.com/detail/mc1872)!

## My Work

I have designed for Discord bot like making Now Playing cards for bot listening to music. If you want, I can do it for you for only 0.5$ - 1$ (12,000 VND - 25,000 VND) depending on the complexity of the design. About the payment method, I will discuss it with you.

I haven't accepted web design and web coding yet because I think I still lack the experience and the ability to do it, but maybe I will in the future. If you want, I can design the web for you if the requirements are not too complicated.

If you like my work, you can support me by following me on my social media accounts. I currently do not accept donations but if you want, you can still contact me. Thanks a lot! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/814532004267819079.png" width="16">

As you can see, I know a few languages and frameworks related to Back-end but really I just learned enough to understand how they work, not really an expert so please don't ask me about them.

In addition, if you want to have the badges as above, you can contact me on Discord, I can do it for you, but it's free or not... it depends.

Most icons are from [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) for VS Code and [Worldvectorlogo](https://worldvectorlogo.com/).
